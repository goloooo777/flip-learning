# Usage

Code will be released soon.

# Results

Two testing cases of multi-agent erasing (stage 2). The blue bbox contains the nodule to be segmented. The red and green bbox are two agents. They traverse the superpixels and there are only two actions including erasing (solid yellow bbox) and passing (hollow yellow bbox).
