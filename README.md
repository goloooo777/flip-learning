# Flip Learning: Erase to Segment

A weakly-supervised segmentation method based on `Reinforcement Learning` that only needs bbox label.

## Framework

## Environment

* Python  
* Pytorch  
* OpenCV  
* Gym  

## Usage 

### Dataset Setting

```
-- data  
   --- subjects1  
       --- data.png # the original image
       --- data_crop.png # the background image generated by the crop-paste method
       --- nodule.npy  # the BBox information: (x1,y1,x2,y2)
       --- mask.png  # for evaluation only [Not required in the testing phase!]
   ...
```
### Testing

We have provided some testing cases in *testing images* filefolder and uploaded the testing software based on our proposed flip-learning method to OneDrive (*flip_learning.exe* in the *zip* file, see https://1drv.ms/u/s!AowDfwnjiDZrbNK6AJOQ-4XcdDc?e=0n1skz). The trained model are provided in the *model* filefolder. It is noted that the classification model *cls.pt* is not required in the testing phase to get the predicted segmentation. Here, we only use this classifier for obtaining the classification score and drawing the erasing curve.

The function of our testing software is illustrated as followed:  

- Input image  
`Load:` Load the image to be segmented.  
- Visualization-pre (pre-process)  
`BBox:` Visualize the BBox on the image.  
`Superpixel:` Visualize the superpixel on the image. If *mask.png* exists, the nodule boundary will be drawn.  
- Visualization-result (predicted result)  
`Predict-m:` Visualize the mask after post-process (erode/hole-filling/dilate).  
`Predict-o:` Visualize the predicted mask boundary on the original image.  
`Predict-c:` If *mask.png* exists, compare the mask boundaries of predicted mask and ground truth on the original image.  
`Predict-f:` Visualize the erased image with the tag 'Normal tissue'.  
`Predict-e:` If *mask.png* exists, draw the erasing curve including DICE, classification score, and erased area.
  
- Visualization-gif     
`Gif-erasing:` Visualize the multi-agent erasing process.

The predictions and visualization results will be stored in the *save* filefolder.

## Results
1. Examples of superpixels. The first row shows the coarse superpixels, and the second row shows the corresponding fine superpixels.

2. Results of two stages. The right corner figures show the superpixels and the erased areas are marked in blue.

3. Two testing cases of multi-agent erasing (stage 2). The blue bbox contains the nodule to be segmented. The red and green bboxes are two agents. They traverse the superpixels with actions including 1) erasing (solid yellow bbox) and 2) passing (hollow yellow bbox). From left to right show the multi-agent erasing process, ground truth and prediction, respectively. Results have been post-processed.

4. Visualization of classification tag flipping . The left figure shows the original image with the tag 'Nodule' and the erasing process. The middle one visualizes the erasing curve including erasing area, classification score of nodule and DICE in each step. The last figure shows the image after tag flipping (i.e., with tag 'Normal tissue').
